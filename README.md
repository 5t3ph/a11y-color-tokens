# a11y-color-tokens

> Generate accessible complementary text or UI colors as Sass variables and/or CSS custom properties from your base color tokens.

## Why do I need this?

While many tools are available to _check_ contrast, but efficiently picking an accessible palette can be time-consuming and frustrating. As someone with way too many side projects, I'll say that color contrast is always something that slows down my workflow. In fact, I built this precisely to speed up my own process!

Additionally, everyone benefits from documentation about color token contrast to ensure tokens are _used_ accessibly.

`a11y-color-tokens` lets you focus on just selecting the base colors while taking care of generating contrast-safe complementary tones to ensure you meet [this important success criterion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html). A unique feature of this project is that it scales the original color value for a more pleasing visual contrast vs only returning either white or black. (_Don't worry - you're able to override the contrast color if needed!_)

> 💡 "Tokens" comes from the design system world terminology of "design tokens" which you can [learn more about from the original creator, Jina Anne](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/11/smashing-podcast-episode-3/).

## What's in the box

**Example output**:

```scss
// `primary` name and value provided in your tokens
$color-primary: rebeccapurple !default;
// `on-primary` name and value generated by a11y-color-tokens
// and guaranteed to have at least 4.5 contrast with `primary`
$color-on-primary: #ceb3e9 !default;
// Also includes a list based on your provided color names
$base-color-tokens: ("primary", "secondary");
```

The default options generate individual Sass variables, as well as a map of those variables and a mixin that contains the palette as CSS custom properties, ready for you to drop into `:root` or another location of your choice.

Sass variables and the map include the `!default` flag as an additional way to extend, scale, and share your tokens.

**[View the sample default output >](https://github.com/5t3ph/a11y-color-tokens/blob/main/sass/_color-tokens.scss)**

Alternatively, pass `"css"` as the `tokenOutputFormat` to only output CSS custom properties within the `:root` selector.

Additionally, [an optional Markdown document](https://github.com/5t3ph/a11y-color-tokens/blob/main/sass/_color-token-contrast.md) is generated with contrast cross-compatibility between all available color tokens.

## Usage

Install `a11y-color-tokens` into any project using:

```bash
npm install a11y-color-tokens --save-dev
```

You can then add it to your scripts or call it directly from the command line, but first, you must prepare a color tokens file.

### Create Color Tokens File

**Before the script will work**, you will need to prepare your color tokens as a module that exports the tokens array.

The expected format is as follows:

```js
// Example color-tokens.js
module.exports = [
  {
    /*
     * `name` - Required
     * Any string, will be used for color reference
     */
    name: "primary",
    /*
     * `color` - Required
     * Any valid CSS color value
     */
    color: "rgb(56, 84, 230)",
    /*
     * `onColor` - Optional
     * enum: undefined | "[css color value]" | false
     *
     * If undefined, will be generated as relative tone of `color`
     * that meets contrast according to `ratioKey`
     *
     * If a color value provided, will still be checked for contrast
     * and a warning comment added if it doesn't pass
     *
     * Set to `false` to omit generation
     */
    /*
     * `ratioKey` - Optional
     * enum: undefined | "small" (default) | "large"
     *
     * Corresponds to mimimum contrast for either normal text ("small" = 4.5)
     * or large text/user interface components ("large" = 3)
     */
  },
];
```

View [color-tokens.js](https://github.com/5t3ph/a11y-color-tokens/blob/main/color-tokens.js) in the package repo for more full example.

### Recommended Setup

Add as a standalone script, and then call prior to your build and start commands to ensure tokens are always fresh.

> At minimum, be sure to pass an existing `outputDirPath` (default: `"sass"`) and point `colorTokensPath` (default: `"color-tokens.js"`) to your tokens file.

```json
"scripts": {
  "color-tokens": "a11y-color-tokens --outputDirPath='src/sass' --colorTokensPath='_theme/color-tokens.js'",
  "start": "npm-run-all color-tokens [your other scripts]",
  "build": "npm-run-all color-tokens [your other scripts]"
},
```

_**Sass processing is not included**, you must add that separately. This package is a great companion to my [11ty-sass-skeleton template](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-sass-skeleton) which is a barebones Eleventy static site_.

| includeCustomProperties | boolean                 | true                   |
| customPropertiesFormat  | enum: "mixin" \| "root" | "mixin"                |

> To set a boolean option to `false`, format the option as `--no-[optionName]`

## Config Examples

### Vanilla CSS output of custom properties

As noted in the intro, the default output is Sass based.

Flip this to output all generated tokens as CSS custom properties within `:root` with the following:

```bash
a11y-color-tokens --tokenOutputFormat='css' --outputFilename='theme-colors.css'
```

> For the CSS-only output, you will need to update `outputFilename` since the default creates this output as a Sass (`.scss`) file.

### Direct `:root` Sass output of custom properties

The default creates a `mixin` containing the CSS custom properties version of the tokens. If you'd rather output them in `:root` directly, set the following:

```bash
a11y-color-tokens --customPropertiesFormat='root'
```

### Update Sass map and mixin name

This is handled by updating the following:

```bash
a11y-color-tokens --sassOutputName='colors'
```

### Update or remove the generated token prefix

Change the prefix of `color-` by setting a new value, or use `--no-tokenPrefix` to remove token prefixing.

```bash
a11y-color-tokens --tokenPrefix='theme-'
```

### Prevent CSS custom properties output

This is handled with `includeCustomProperties` and can be removed with:

```bash
a11y-color-tokens --no-includeCustomProperties
```

### Remove the `_color-token-contrast.md` documentation

This is handled with `compatibilityDocs` and can be removed with:

```bash
a11y-color-tokens --no-compatibilityDocs
```

### Change output location of `_color-token-contrast.md`

The default places the docs in the same directory defined for `outputDirPath`.

To change, supply a new file path (the `_` prefix will be removed from the Markdown filename as well):

```bash
a11y-color-tokens --compatibilityDocsPath='docs'
```
